- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi colons, etc)
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process, auxiliary tools, libraries

**Examples:**
```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 integration

Implement OAuth2 authentication flow with support for multiple providers.
Includes token refresh logic and secure storage mechanisms.

Closes #123
```

```
