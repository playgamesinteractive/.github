# Security Policy

Play Games Interactive takes the security of our software products and services seriously. This document outlines our security practices, how to report security vulnerabilities, and our commitment to maintaining the highest security standards.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions of our projects:

| Version | Supported          | End of Support |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| Latest Release | ✅ Full Support | N/A |
| Previous Major | ✅ Security Updates Only | 12 months after latest release |
| Older Versions | ❌ No longer supported | Discontinued |

**Note**: We strongly recommend always using the latest supported version to ensure you have the most recent security patches and improvements.

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
We implement multiple layers of security controls throughout our systems and applications:

- **Application Security**: Secure coding practices, input validation, output encoding
- **Infrastructure Security**: Network segmentation, access controls, monitoring
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit, secure key management
- **Identity and Access Management**: Strong authentication, least privilege access
- **Monitoring and Detection**: Continuous security monitoring, incident response

### Zero Trust Architecture
Our systems are designed with zero trust principles:
- Never trust, always verify
- Assume breach mentality
- Continuous validation of security posture
- Minimal access permissions

### Privacy by Design
Security and privacy are integrated into our development process from the ground up:
- Data minimization principles
- Purpose limitation
- Transparency and user control
- Security by default

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**IMPORTANT**: Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or any public channels.

### Responsible Disclosure Process

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities through our private reporting channel:

**Primary Contact**: security@playgamesinteractive.com  
**PGP Public Key**: [Available upon request]  
**Signal**: Available for high-severity issues (contact via email first)

### Severity Classification

We use the CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) framework to assess vulnerability severity:

**Critical (9.0-10.0)**
- Remote code execution
- Full system compromise
- Large-scale data breach potential

**High (7.0-8.9)**
- Significant data exposure
- Privilege escalation
- Authentication bypass

**Medium (4.0-6.9)**
- Limited information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Local privilege escalation

**Low (0.1-3.9)**
- Minimal security impact
- Information gathering
- Low-impact denial of service
